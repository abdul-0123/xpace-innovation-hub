        <h1>Xpace Innovation Hub</h1>
        
        Xpace is a one of it's kind website for innovation.
        <p> We live in a civilized age where people desire new
            modern technology like electric cars, smart homes,
            electric trains that can take you anywhere in the 
            world, you name it. But we should all get one
            question clear and that is How do we achieve
            that and the answer is our creative thinking.
            Using our big brains and utilised in different areas 
            of technology.
        </p>    
        <h2>Areas of technological innovation</h2>
        <p> Now how do we go about this? Innovation comes in various
            areas. They are
           <ul>
          <li> Mental thinking </li>
          <li> Invention </li>
          <li> Explantion </li>
          <li> Resolution </li>
           </ul> 
            All this when combined will create an easier world to live.
            <br> Now let me give you an example. Perhaps you went to a tech 
            company and you met some guys that really want to help you
            start up your job. What is the first thing you think they
            are going to tell you ? Simple. They tell you the things the 
            company wants to achieve and you will interprete them into 
            ideas in your own way of thinking. Have you ever wondered how
            Prof. Graham Bell invented the telephone or how Charles Babbage
            invented the computer. It's straight forward thinking. The 
            ability to think and express thoughts with your invented
            creation 
        </p>
        <h3> About Xpace </h3>  
        <p> At this stage we will list out some of the things which
            will be done on this website. See the table below:
        <br>
        <table border="10">
